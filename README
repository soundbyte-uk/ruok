ruok: Resisting ugly output khaos

Basically making sure text files are ok, to resist the most basic ways in which badly-configured editors start to sabotage and disrupt changes later in a project's lifespan.

Files should always end with a trailing newline.

Lines with trailing spaces are almost always wrong.

It's ideal to check for these problems, either with a pre-commit hook or a pre-receive hook, to reject untidy changes, get editors fixed quickly and keep things neat so that a future person doesn't have to fix them later -- or deal with a messy diff when they're in the middle of trying to do a big unrelated automated change (for example).

This is not a Git hook, but is just a simple program for quickly checking a list of text files, which can be used as part of a Git hook.

I'm using intentionally fun and nasty Perl (with Bourne shell unit tests) to celebrate and mourn the Old Ways.

Perl is underappreciatedly fast, stable and lightweight, and is still included in many small systems where other more "modern" interpreted languages are not.
